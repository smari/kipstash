Background:
===========

Many not so computer savvy human rights activists around the world use dropbox to backup and share as well as work collaborative on files. There are several threats associated with dropbox like the fact that files are stored in dropbox are not encrypted by default so it can be retrieved in cleartext by third parties. Also the whole infrastructure is in the hand of one private corporation with can be set under pressure. Files are not secure agains manipulation (while stored on the server) and many more.

Therefore this projects tries to come up with a secure by default, robust and easy to use solution for activists.
