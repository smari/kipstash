kipstach aims to provide a secure, privacy friendly, remote data-storage. 
That can be used to store and share information.

Features:

* open source
* easy to use
* have the option to run your own server

Secure in this context means:
* protect data from beeing read by unauthorized parties while stored on 
  the server
* protect data from beeing maipulated by unauthorized parties while stored on 
  the server
* protect data from beeing read or manipulated while in transit toward 
  the server

privacy friendly in this context means:
* the server knows as little as possible about its users.
* the server knows as little as possible about the content stored by users.

Share data:

In order to share data two requirements need to be solved:
# you need to have the public key of users you want to share data with.
# you need to put the data on a server both of you have access to.

See doc/IDEAS for ideas how to overcome the requirement that users need to 
have access to the same server in order to share.
